## Who we are and what we do

Welcome to *Skies*' blog. We are a small startup (team of 7 people) working on fun topics:  Cloud, Big Data, distributed systems, automated deployment and storage.
Our offices are located in France (Nancy/Metz). 

More precisely, we are working on *Smart Storage*, a *software-defined storage solution* targeting companies storing terabytes of data (and more).

We hope to:

- Reduce the energy consumption of servers.
- Understand the data to store them more efficiently, leading to space savings.

## Why a blog?

As engineers, we face technical challenges on a daily basis, we learn a lot and we have a ton we would like to talk about.
This blog is a platform to discuss engineering topics and explain the thought process behind our choices and the things we do.

But this is not only a tech blog, we would like to also write about things we are passionate, care about or just hold our attention. You may find articles related to various fields or topic such as marketing, cool furnitures for your offices, lifestyle, growth hacking and much more.
Our goal is to share with you, the startup and tech communities, our journey as a growing start-up.

We don't claim to be 100% right or detain the absolute truth, that's why we have a comment section. 
Feel free to reach out to us to foster productive discussions!
