## Who we are and what we do

We are a small tech startup (team of 7 people) working on *Smart Storage*, a *software-defined storage solution* targeting companies storing buttloads of data.
We are tackling fun topics related but not limited to : Cloud, Big Data, distributed systems, automated deployment and storage.

With our product, we hope to:

- Reduce the energy consumption of servers.
- Understand the data to store them more efficiently, leading to space savings.

Our offices are located in France (Nancy/Metz) but we also have a remote fellow in Kent, UK.

## Why a blog?

As engineers, we face technical challenges on a daily basis, we learn a lot and we have a ton we would like to talk about.

Coding is in our ADN but this is not only a tech blog, we would like to also write about things we are passionate, care about or just hold our attention. You may find articles related to various fields or topic such as company's culture, marketing, growth hacking, cool furnitures for your offices and much more.

Our goal is to share with you, the startup and tech communities, our journey as a growing start-up.

We don't claim to be 100% right or detain the absolute truth, that's why we have a comment section.
Feel free to reach out to us to foster productive discussions.
