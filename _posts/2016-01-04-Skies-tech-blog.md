## Who we are and what we do

Welcome to *Skies*' tech blog. We are a small startup (team of 6 tech people) working on fun topics:  Cloud, Big Data, distributed systems, automated deployment and storage.
More precisely, we are working on *Smart Storage*, a *software-defined storage solution* targeting companies storing terrabytes and petabytes of data. 

We hope to:

- Reduce the energy consumption of servers.
- Understand the data to store them more efficiently, leading to space gains.

## Why a tech blog?

As engineers, we face technical challenges on a daily basis, we learn a lot and we have a ton that we would like to talk about.
This blog is a platform to discuss engineering topics and explain the thought process behind our choices and the things we do.
Our goal is to share with you, the tech community, our journey as a growing start-up.

We don't claim to be 100% right or detain the absolute truth, that's why we have a comment section. 
Feel free to reach out to us to foster productive discussions!
